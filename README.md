## Install

This repository contains Smart Contract code in Solidity (using Truffle), tests (also using Truffle)

To install, download or clone the repo, then:

`npm install`

In directory `eth-contracts/`  
`truffle compile`

## Tests
To run truffle tests:
In directory `eth-contracts/`

For all tests:    
`truffle test` 

All 13 tests should pass.

For single file tests:  
`truffle test test/TestERC721Mintable.js`  
`truffle test test/TestSquareVerifier.js`  
`truffle test test/TestSolnSquareVerifier.js`

## ZoKrates (generate zk-Snarks Validator)
#### Step 1: Run ZoKrates in Docker
``` 
docker run -v <path to your project folder>:/home/zokrates/code -ti zokrates/zokrates:0.3.0 /bin/bash
```

#### Change directory
``` 
cd code/zokrates/code/square/
``` 

#### Step 2: Compile the program written in ZoKrates DSL
``` 
../../../../zokrates compile -i square.code
``` 

#### Step 3: Generate the Trusted Setup
``` 
../../../../zokrates setup
```

#### Step 4: Compute Witness
``` 
../../../../zokrates compute-witness -a 3 9
```

#### Step 5: Generate Proof
```
../../../../zokrates generate-proof
```

#### Step 6: Export Verifier
```  
../../../../zokrates export-verifier
```

# Deploy to Rinkeby
Update <**your infura key**> and <**your contract owner address**> in 
`/eth-contracts/truffle-config.js` before migrate to Rinkeby Network. 
And create a `.secret` file in `/eth-contracts/` with your mnemonic.

Example `.secret` content:
```
make soup average fence better canvas house like mystery happy holiday
``` 
 
Start deployment
```
truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```

#Minting tokens
After deploying to the Rinkeby network, there will be a contract on Rinkeby that will be viewable on Rinkeby Etherscan. For example, here is a recently deployed contract. You should set this contract address and the address of your Metamask account as environment variables when running the minting script:

```
export MNEMONIC="<mnemonic>"
export INFURA_KEY="<infura_key>"
export OWNER_ADDRESS="<owner_address>"
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS="<deployed_contract_address>"
export NETWORK="rinkeby"

node scripts/mint.js
```

The output of the `mint.js` script should look like this.

# Known Bugs / Improvements
Roots and squares as input to ZoKrates is not directly related to the real estate property use case. 
It is just meant to show how the process can be done programmatically. 
There might be other data that can be input to ZoKrates to verify land titles.

The metadata API from AWS provided seem to have formatting errors. 
You may want to study the metadata format presented [here](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/2-adding-metadata) and generate your own API via Heroku with [this guide](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/metadata-api-nodejs). 
From there, you can modify the names and images per token. 
Just deploy a new contract with a different base tokenURI to access your API.
